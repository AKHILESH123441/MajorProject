Election prediction Using ML


Major project is mainly based on the Elections
I every election there are some mistakes are happening. Those are affect the election in terms of winning the person.
In this way we gathered some past data in indian elections. We summerized that and divided that as training and testing.
In data preprocessig if any vote is appearing then by using some Machine learning algorithm we replace that with some special symbols.
